# charlesr1971.github.io

> A personal playground for building small, focused web apps — powered by AI prompts.

## 🤖 About

This site is a living collection of mini-apps and experiments created through AI-assisted development. Each project starts with a prompt and evolves into a working, self-contained tool. The goal is to explore what's possible when human creativity meets AI generation — quickly, iteratively, and without unnecessary overhead.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

- **Prompt-driven apps** — small utilities and tools built primarily using AI prompts
- **Experiments** — quick prototypes exploring ideas, interactions, and interfaces
- **Iterations** — refined versions of earlier experiments, improved through follow-up prompts

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Apps on this site are typically built with a combination of:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla or lightweight frameworks)
- AI tools such as Claude, ChatGPT, or similar for code generation
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## 📂 Structure

Each app lives in its own directory and is designed to be self-contained:

```
charlesr1971.github.io/
├── index.html          # Landing page / app directory
├── app-one/            # Individual app folders
│   └── index.html
├── app-two/
│   └── index.html
└── ...
```

## 💡 Philosophy

The apps here embrace a **prompt-first** approach to development:

1. Start with a clear idea
2. Write a focused AI prompt
3. Iterate and refine
4. Ship it

Speed and simplicity are valued over complexity. If an idea can be expressed in a single-page app, that's exactly how it's built.
